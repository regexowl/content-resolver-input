# Configs for Content Resolver

This repository contains all the configuration for [Content Resolver](https://tiny.distro.builders).

See [config specs](https://github.com/minimization/content-resolver/tree/master/config_specs) for reference. 

## Locating the right file

Instead of browsing this repository directly, it's easier to find the file you're looking for through [Content Resolver](https://tiny.distro.builders) directly.

Option 1: Look at the [Configuration](https://tiny.distro.builders/configs_workloads.html) space that lists all the configs. You can search through them, see their details, and use the *Edit Configuration* button on their pages to get to the right file in this repository.

Option 2: Almost every page under [Results](https://tiny.distro.builders/workloads.html) has a link to its configuration file. The link is usually located at right side of each page.

In both cases, you can edit the config and send a PR right from your web browser.
